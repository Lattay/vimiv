.SH DESCRIPTION
Vimiv is an image viewer with vim-like keybindings for X. It is written in
python and works well with tiling window managers.
.P
Vimiv features two different modes of operation: image, and thumbnail mode.
Additionally there are two popup windows: the library popup and the manipulation
popup. If a file is passed to vimiv it starts in image mode, otherwise a quick
error is displayed and the library popup appears.
.P
In image mode the current image and possibly a statusbar is shown. It is
possible to navigate through the images and apply basic actions.
.P
In thumbnail mode a grid of small previews and the name of each image is
displayed. It is useful for getting an overview of the open images and for
selecting a specific one.
.P
The library popup is a window with a list of the current images. One can select
any image or navigate the directory tree to load new images.
.P
The manipulate popup is a small window with further image editing options.
These feature the change of brightness and contrast and a button called
"optimize". This button uses imagemagick to optimize contrast, gamma and level
of the image. This tends to work well with photographs.

.SH CONFIGURATION
All keyboard commands and some additional settings can be configured in
"/etc/vimivrc.py" or in "~/.vimiv/vimivrc.py" (recommended). This file is python
code which declares variables used in the actual program. Since python code is
very readable this should not be an issue. The following settings can also be
configured:

.TP
.BR start_fullscreen\ (Bool)
If True start in fullscreen mode.
.TP
.BR start_slideshow\ (Bool)
If True start in slideshow mode.
.TP
.BR slideshow_delay\ (Float)
Specify the delay in slideshow mode.
.TP
.BR shuffle\ (Bool)
If True shuffle the images in filelist.
.TP
.BR display_bar\ (Bool)
If True show the statusbar.
.TP
.BR thumbsize\ (tuple)
Size for the thumbnails.
.TP
.BR tiling_wm\ (Bool)
If True optimize behaviour for tiling window managers. Geometry will not be
parsed but vimiv will wait for the window manager to resize the window and then
update the image.
.TP
.BR geometry\ (string)
A string of the form "WIDTHxHEIGHT" which sets the default size for the image.
This is only used if tiling_wm is False.
.TP
.BR recursive\ (Bool)
If True search the given directory recursively for images.
.SH THUMBNAIL CACHING
Thumbnails are cached under "~/.vimiv/Thumbnails" so they can be loaded a lot
faster.
.SH IMAGE MANIPULATION
The basic manipulations (rotate, flip, ...) are automatically also applied to
the file. The file is overwritten. The more advanced manipulations which can be
accessed in manipulation mode are only written to the actual file if one selects
"Accept changes", otherwise they are ignored. For the "optimize" button
imagemagick must be installed.
.SH LIBRARY VIEWER
Users of "ranger" should be familiar with the concept. This library viewer will
only show files which it recognizes as images and directories as vimiv can and
should not access other files. If an image is selected vimiv will populate a new
filelist with all images in the same directory, close the library viewer  and
focus the selected image. If a directory is selected, all accessible files in
that directory will be shown in the library
