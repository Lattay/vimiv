### Contributing to vimiv
You want to contribute? Great!

Here are some general recommendations to make the process easier for me. If any
of them stop you from contributing, please do so anyway and I will fix them
myself!

Your new code should not break any existing tests or, if it is an actual change,
rewrite the test so it works with the new code. If you introduce a new feature,
you might be asked to write tests for it. The tests can be run with make test
and use nosetests. The code should follow the included .pylintrc.

## Open issues
A great way to help is to work on open issues. Check out the issue tracker if
there is anything of your interest.

## New features
If you would like to implement a new feature it might be a good idea to send me
an email to "christian dot karl at protonmail dot com" or open an issue to ask
if I would like to see it implemented. Otherwise you might be disappointed
afterwards if I do not accept your pull request. In general though I am very
happy about any interest in vimiv!

## Testing and bug reporting
Fairly obvious. Just open an issue or send me an email. If you feel adventurous,
you can test the unreleased branches depending on whether a new version is
currently under development.
