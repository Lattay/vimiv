### Reporting bugs
If possible, please reproduce the bug running with --debug and include the
content of the created logfile in $XDG_DATA_HOME/vimiv/vimiv.log.

Vimiv tries to maintain backward compatibility with the latest Ubuntu LTS
version. Supporting older systems is not planned and things will almost
certainly break on them.
