### Vimiv, an image viewer with vim-like keybindings

## Features
Vim-like keybindings, thumbnail mode and basic image editing 
(rotate, flip, brightness, contrast and optimize).

can copy the file to `~/.vimiv/vimivrc` and modify that file instead
(recommended).

## Dependencies
pygobject, python-pillow, imagemagick (for the optimization)
